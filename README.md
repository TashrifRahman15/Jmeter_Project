# JMeter Performance Testing
## Project Overview
This project contains JMeter performance test collections for two scenarios:
##  Task1 Performance Testing for Booking API
In the scenario Total user: 120000 and Time Period: 12 hours = 12 * 60 * 60 seconds = 43,200 seconds
Throughput (Requests per Second): 120,000 users / 43,200 seconds â‰ˆ 2.78 requests/second
##### Conducted tests in 3 steps:
- 5-minute load test
- 10-minute load test
- 20-minute load test
### Load Test & Throughput Analysis
- Limited the test duration to a maximum of 20 minutes.
- Verified whether the server can handle the expected load.

### Stress Test & Bottleneck Identification
After doing a load test for 20 minutes, Gradually increased the load in steps until the server started failing.

## Prerequisites
- Apache JMeter (latest version recommended)
- Java 8 or later
- Clone this repository from GitHub
## How to run?
#### Task 1: Running the Booking API Load & Stress Tests
- Open Apache JMeter.
- Load the booking.jmx file.
- Run the test for the required duration.
- View results in the HTML report folder.
####  Task 2: Running the DMoney API Test
- Load the dmoney.jmx file in JMeter.
- Ensure the CSV files (deposit.csv, sendMoney.csv, payment.csv) are placed in the same directory.
- Run the test and validate the response assertions.
##  Notes
dmoney.jtl and the HTML report folder are excluded from GitHub using .gitignore.
